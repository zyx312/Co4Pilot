## Experiment Design Framework

### Phase 1: Research Question → Experimental Variables

```
Independent Variables (IV):
  - Method variants (proposed vs baselines vs ablations)
  - Environmental conditions (weather, lighting, traffic density)
  - Scenario parameters (speed, distance, timing)
  - System configuration (sensor suite, compute budget)

Dependent Variables (DV):
  - Safety metrics (collision rate, TTC, DRAC)
  - Performance metrics (mAP, ADE, driving score)
  - Efficiency metrics (inference time, compute cost)
  - Robustness metrics (performance degradation under perturbation)

Control Variables:
  - Dataset split (train/val/test)
  - Random seeds (report mean ± std over N seeds)
  - Hardware/software versions
  - Hyperparameters (fix across comparisons)
```

### Phase 2: Test Matrix Design

For scenario-based experiments, use a structured test matrix:

```
Scenario Parameters:
  - Ego speed: {30, 50, 70, 90, 110} km/h
  - Target distance: {10, 20, 30, 50, 80} m
  - Lateral offset: {0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5} m
  - Weather: {clear, light_rain, heavy_rain, fog, night}

Coverage strategy:
  - Full factorial: All combinations (expensive but thorough)
  - Latin hypercube: Efficient sampling of parameter space
  - Boundary value: Focus on ODD boundaries
  - Risk-based: Prioritize high-criticality combinations
```

### Phase 3: Statistical Analysis

**For benchmark comparisons:**
- Report mean and standard deviation over multiple seeds (min 3, prefer 5)
- Use paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank for pairwise comparison
- For multiple comparisons: Bonferroni correction or Tukey HSD
- Report effect size (Cohen's d) for practical significance
- Report confidence intervals (95% CI)

**For safety claims:**
- Statistical testing for rare events: Importance sampling, extreme value theory
- Exposure-based metrics: events per million miles/km driven
- Confidence bounds: How many miles needed to demonstrate X safety level?
  - Rule of thumb (Kalra & Paddock, 2016): ~275 million miles for fatality rate claim
  - Scenario-based approaches can reduce this significantly

**For ablation studies:**
- One variable at a time (OVAT) for clarity
- Report relative and absolute performance changes
- Statistical significance for each ablation

### Phase 4: Reproducibility Checklist

```
□ Random seeds specified and varied
□ Hardware specified (GPU type, count, memory)
□ Software versions listed (PyTorch, CUDA, framework versions)
□ Training details (epochs, learning rate schedule, batch size, optimizer)
□ Dataset version and split specified
□ Pre-processing pipeline documented
□ Inference time measured (batch size, hardware, with/without post-processing)
□ Code availability (GitHub link, license)
□ Model checkpoints available (optional but valued)
```

## Common Experimental Pitfalls

1. **Train/test leakage**: Especially with temporal data — ensure no future information leaks
2. **Cherry-picked scenarios**: Report aggregate metrics, not just best cases
3. **Unfair baselines**: Re-run baselines with same data augmentation and training schedule
4. **Missing failure analysis**: Always show where the method fails
5. **Single seed**: Never report single-run results for stochastic methods
6. **Ignoring latency**: AD requires real-time; report wall-clock inference time
7. **Simulation-only**: Acknowledge sim-to-real gap; discuss transferability
8. **Class imbalance**: AD data is long-tailed; report per-class metrics
9. **Missing confidence intervals**: Critical for safety claims
10. **Overfitting to benchmarks**: Discuss generalization beyond the specific benchmark
