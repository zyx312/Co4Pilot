## Safety Metrics Computation

### Crash Rate Metrics

```python
# Crashes per million vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
crash_rate = (num_crashes / total_vmt) * 1_000_000

# Crashes per million vehicle hours traveled (VHT)
crash_rate_time = (num_crashes / total_vht) * 1_000_000

# Fatal crash rate
fatal_rate = (num_fatal_crashes / total_vmt) * 100_000_000  # per 100M VMT

# Injury crash rate by severity (KABCO scale)
# K = Fatal, A = Incapacitating, B = Non-incapacitating, C = Possible, O = No injury
```

### Exposure-Based Analysis

```python
# Relative risk (RR)
RR = (crash_rate_exposed / crash_rate_unexposed)

# Odds ratio (OR) — for case-control studies
OR = (a * d) / (b * c)  # 2x2 contingency table

# Induced exposure method — use not-at-fault drivers as exposure proxy
# Two-vehicle crashes: at-fault vs not-at-fault driver characteristics
exposure_weight = not_at_fault_proportion_by_category
```

### Surrogate Safety Measures (from trajectory data)

```python
# Time-to-Collision (TTC)
TTC = distance / relative_speed  # for approaching vehicles

# Modified TTC (accounts for deceleration)
TTC_modified = (v_lead - v_ego) / (2 * a_max) + distance / v_ego

# Post-Encroachment Time (PET)
PET = t_second_vehicle_at_conflict - t_first_vehicle_clears_conflict

# Deceleration Rate to Avoid Crash (DRAC)
DRAC = (v_ego - v_lead)**2 / (2 * distance)

# Time Exposed TTC (TET)
TET = sum(dt for t in trajectory if TTC(t) < threshold)

# Time Integrated TTC (TIT)
TIT = sum((threshold - TTC(t)) * dt for t in trajectory if TTC(t) < threshold)

# Maximum speed (Vmax), Maximum deceleration
# Lateral acceleration, jerk
```

### Statistical Significance for Safety Claims

```python
# Poisson test for crash rate comparison
from scipy.stats import poisson
# H0: crash_rate_ADS >= crash_rate_human
# Compute p-value using Poisson distribution

# Required sample size for safety demonstration
# (Kalra & Paddock, 2016)
# To demonstrate ADS is X times safer than human:
# Miles needed ≈ (z_alpha + z_beta)^2 / (crash_rate * (1 - 1/X)^2)

# Example: Demonstrate 2x safer than human fatality rate (1.1 per 100M miles)
# Need ~275 million miles (at 95% confidence, 80% power)

# Bayesian approach for small samples
# Prior: informed by human crash rate
# Likelihood: Poisson/negative binomial for crash counts
# Posterior: updated crash rate estimate with credible intervals

# Extreme value theory for near-miss extrapolation
# Fit GPD (Generalized Pareto Distribution) to surrogate safety measure peaks
# Extrapolate to estimate crash probability from near-miss data
```

## Analysis Workflows

### Workflow 1: Crash Type Distribution Analysis
1. Query crash database (FARS/CRSS) for relevant crashes
2. Filter by crash type (e.g., rear-end, angle, pedestrian)
3. Cross-tabulate by contributing factors (distraction, impairment, speed)
4. Compute proportions and confidence intervals
5. Compare with AD-relevant scenarios
6. Identify which crash types AD could prevent and residual crash types

### Workflow 2: ADS Safety Comparison
1. Obtain ADS crash/incident data (SGO reports, company disclosures)
2. Compute ADS crash rate (crashes per million miles, by severity)
3. Obtain comparable human baseline (CRSS weighted, matched conditions)
4. **Critical**: Match on ODD conditions (road type, weather, time of day, geography)
5. Compute relative risk with confidence intervals
6. Sensitivity analysis: vary matching criteria, examine robustness

### Workflow 3: Surrogate Safety from Trajectory Data
1. Extract trajectories from dataset (nuScenes, Waymo, drone data)
2. Identify conflict pairs (vehicles, vehicle-pedestrian, vehicle-cyclist)
3. Compute surrogate safety measures (TTC, PET, DRAC) at each timestep
4. Define thresholds for "critical events" (e.g., TTC < 1.5s)
5. Analyze distribution of critical events
6. Optional: Extreme value modeling to extrapolate crash probability

### Workflow 4: Pre-Crash Scenario Reconstruction
1. Select crash cases from in-depth database (GIDAS, CISS)
2. Reconstruct pre-crash trajectories from EDR/scene data
3. Identify the critical event and contributing factors
4. Map to scenario taxonomy (6-layer model)
5. Parameterize as logical scenarios for simulation replay
6. Test AD system response in reconstructed scenarios

## Common Analysis Tools

```python
# Python ecosystem for AD safety data analysis
import pandas as pd          # Data manipulation
import numpy as np            # Numerical computation
import scipy.stats as stats   # Statistical tests
import statsmodels.api as sm  # Regression, GLM, survival analysis
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Visualization
import seaborn as sns         # Statistical visualization

# Specialized libraries
# pyproj — coordinate transformations
# geopandas — geospatial analysis of crash locations
# lifelines — survival analysis
# pymc / stan — Bayesian analysis
# scikit-learn — clustering crash patterns, classification
```

## Reporting Standards

When presenting safety data analysis:
1. **State the data source, version, and query criteria** explicitly
2. **Report sample sizes** for all subgroups
3. **Use appropriate statistical tests** (don't use t-tests for crash counts — use Poisson/NB regression)
4. **Report confidence intervals** for all rate estimates
5. **Acknowledge data limitations**: underreporting, selection bias, missing variables
6. **Use standard injury scales**: AIS, KABCO, ISS
7. **Specify the comparison baseline** clearly when making safety claims
8. **Avoid ecological fallacy**: aggregate crash rates ≠ individual risk
9. **Account for exposure differences** when comparing populations
10. **Sensitivity analysis**: show how results change with different assumptions
