## Core Standards

### ISO 26262 — Functional Safety (Road Vehicles)
- **Edition**: 2nd edition (2018), 12 parts
- **Scope**: Safety of E/E systems — addresses systematic failures and random hardware failures
- **Key concepts**: ASIL (A-D), safety lifecycle, safety case, V-model development
- **Limitation for AD**: Designed for driver-in-the-loop; does not fully address AI/ML, SOTIF, or L4+ systems
- **Parts most relevant to AD**:
  - Part 3: Concept phase (HARA)
  - Part 4: Product development at system level
  - Part 6: Product development at software level
  - Part 11: Guidelines on application to semiconductors
  - Part 12: Adaptation for motorcycles (less relevant)

**Key Processes:**
- HARA → Safety Goals → Functional Safety Requirements → Technical Safety Requirements
- Safety Validation (Part 4, Clause 8)
- Confirmation measures (safety audits, safety assessments)

### ISO 21448 — SOTIF (Safety of the Intended Functionality)
- **Published**: 2022
- **Scope**: Addresses hazards from functional insufficiencies and triggering conditions (NOT component failures)
- **Key concepts**: Areas 1-4 (known/unknown × safe/unsafe), triggering conditions, functional insufficiencies
- **Critical for AD**: Directly addresses perception limitations, AI/ML uncertainty, sensor limitations

**SOTIF vs ISO 26262:**
| Aspect | ISO 26262 | ISO 21448 |
|---|---|---|
| Hazard source | Component malfunction | Intended function limitation |
| Example | Sensor hardware failure | Sensor misclassifies object |
| Coverage | Systematic + random failures | Performance limitations + misuse |
| ASIL concept | ASIL A-D | Not ASIL-based (separate risk assessment) |
| AI/ML | Not addressed | Partially addressed |

**Key Clauses:**
- Clause 5: Specification and design of intended functionality
- Clause 6: Identification and evaluation of triggering conditions
- Clause 7: Evaluation and validation of residual risk
- Clause 8-10: Functional modifications, verification, validation

### UL 4600 — Safety Case Framework for Autonomous Products
- **Published**: 2020 (Edition 1), updated 2022 (Edition 2)
- **Scope**: Provides a framework for constructing safety cases; does NOT prescribe specific metrics
- **Key innovation**: Addresses the full AD stack including AI/ML, data, simulation, and operational safety
- **Structure**: Goal-based safety argumentation (GSN/CAE)

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Safety case construction (claims, arguments, evidence)
- AI/ML safety (training data, edge cases, ODD monitoring)
- Simulation and testing adequacy
- Tool qualification and data integrity
- Risk assessment and residual risk acceptance
- Operational safety and fleet management
- Human factors (for L2/L3 systems)

### ISO/PAS 8800 — Safety and AI for Road Vehicles
- **Status**: Published 2024
- **Scope**: Guidance for applying AI safely in road vehicles
- **Key topics**: Data quality, model verification, robustness, explainability, monitoring
- **Relationship**: Intended to support ISO 26262 and ISO 21448 for AI-specific concerns

**Key Areas:**
- AI development lifecycle for automotive
- Data management (collection, labeling, quality)
- AI model properties (robustness, accuracy, uncertainty)
- Verification and validation of AI components
- AI-specific failure modes and mitigations
- Runtime monitoring and OOD detection

### ISO 34502 — Scenario-Based Safety Evaluation Framework
- **Published**: 2022
- **Scope**: Framework for scenario-based safety evaluation of AD systems
- **Key concepts**: Scenario layers, test case derivation, coverage criteria
- **Complements**: ISO 34503 (taxonomy for ODD)

### ISO 34503 — Taxonomy for ODD
- **Published**: 2023
- **Scope**: Standard taxonomy for describing ODD attributes
- **Categories**: Scenery, environmental conditions, dynamic elements, digital information

### SAE J3016 — Levels of Driving Automation
- **Latest**: 2021 revision (SAE J3016_202104)
- **Defines**: Levels 0-5 of driving automation
- **Key distinctions**:
  - L0-L2: Driver performs DDT; ADAS features
  - L3: ADS performs DDT; driver must be fallback-ready (OEDR by driver on request)
  - L4: ADS performs DDT within ODD; achieves MRC if ODD exit
  - L5: ADS performs DDT unconditionally (no ODD limitation)

## Standards for Research Context

### How to Cite Standards in Papers
```
ISO 26262:2018 — "Road vehicles — Functional safety"
ISO 21448:2022 — "Road vehicles — Safety of the intended functionality"
UL 4600:2022 — "Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products"
ISO/PAS 8800:2024 — "Road vehicles — Safety and artificial intelligence"
SAE J3016:2021 — "Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles"
```

### Research Gaps in Current Standards
1. **AI/ML validation**: ISO 26262 insufficient for ML; ISO/PAS 8800 is guidance only
2. **Foundation models**: No standard addresses LLM/VLM use in AD
3. **End-to-end AD**: Standards assume modular architecture; no guidance for E2E systems
4. **Simulation validity**: No accepted standard for sim-to-real transfer fidelity
5. **Long-tail safety**: Statistical insufficiency for proving safety of rare events
6. **Multi-ADS interaction**: Standards focus on single ADS; fleet/mixed traffic not addressed
7. **Cybersecurity-safety integration**: ISO 26262 and ISO 21434 lack unified framework
8. **Data-driven safety case**: Evidence standards for data-driven safety arguments underdefined
9. **Ethical decision-making**: No binding technical standard for ethical dilemmas
10. **Cross-jurisdiction harmonization**: Fragmented regulatory landscape

## Output Format

When answering standards questions:
1. **Cite the specific standard, edition, and clause** (e.g., "ISO 26262:2018, Part 3, Clause 7")
2. **Explain the requirement** in plain language
3. **Connect to research context** — how does this inform research questions?
4. **Note limitations and gaps** — where do standards fall short?
5. **Cross-reference** related standards when applicable
