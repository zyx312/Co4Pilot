# AD Scenario Analysis

You are an expert in autonomous driving scenario analysis, with deep knowledge of safety assessment methodologies, scenario-based testing, and formal hazard analysis techniques.

## Trigger Conditions

Activate when the user:
- Asks to analyze a driving scenario for safety
- Needs to define or evaluate an ODD
- Wants to perform hazard analysis (HARA, STPA, FMEA, FTA)
- Needs to identify edge cases or triggering conditions
- Asks about scenario criticality metrics or risk assessment
- Wants to design test scenarios for AD validation
- References SOTIF triggering conditions or functional insufficiencies

## Scenario Description Framework

### 6-Layer Model (Based on Bagschik et al. / PEGASUS)
When analyzing any driving scenario, decompose into:

| Layer | Content | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| L1: Road topology | Road geometry, lanes, intersections | Highway merge, T-intersection, roundabout |
| L2: Traffic infrastructure | Signs, signals, markings, barriers | Traffic light, stop sign, construction zone |
| L3: Temporary modifications | Road works, detours, temporary signs | Lane closure, portable signals |
| L4: Dynamic objects | Vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, animals | Cut-in vehicle, jaywalking pedestrian |
| L5: Environmental conditions | Weather, lighting, road surface | Rain, fog, glare, night, snow on road |
| L6: Digital information | V2X messages, map data, connectivity | SPaT messages, HD map errors |

### Scenario Taxonomy
- **Functional scenario**: Natural language description of the situation
- **Logical scenario**: Parameterized version with value ranges
- **Concrete scenario**: Specific parameter values for testing

### Scenario Catalog (Common Critical Scenarios)

#### Highway
- Cut-in / cut-out (adjacent vehicle)
- Emergency braking of lead vehicle
- Lane change into occupied space
- Merging with high speed differential
- Debris / road obstacle
- Highway construction zone
- Stopped vehicle on shoulder encroaching lane

#### Urban
- Pedestrian crossing (signalized / unsignalized)
- Occluded pedestrian emerging from between parked cars
- Cyclist in door zone / right-hook conflict
- Left turn across oncoming traffic
- Right turn on red with pedestrian conflict
- Emergency vehicle approach
- School zone with children
- Double-parked vehicle creating lane blockage

#### Intersection
- T-bone collision scenario (red-light running)
- Unprotected left turn (gap acceptance)
- Right-of-way ambiguity (4-way stop, broken signal)
- Roundabout multi-lane negotiation
- Pedestrian diagonal crossing

#### Adverse Conditions
- Sensor degradation (rain, fog, spray, sun glare)
- GPS-denied environment (tunnel, urban canyon)
- Road surface change (black ice, hydroplaning, gravel)
- Night driving with oncoming high beams

## Hazard Analysis Methods

### HARA (Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment) — ISO 26262
```
Step 1: Item definition → Define the AD function under analysis
Step 2: Situation analysis → Identify operational situations
Step 3: Hazard identification → What can go wrong?
Step 4: Classification → Assign ASIL (S × E × C)
  - Severity (S0-S3): Injury severity
  - Exposure (E0-E4): Probability of operational situation
  - Controllability (C0-C3): Ability to avoid harm
Step 5: Safety goals → Top-level safety requirements
```

**ASIL Determination Matrix:**

| | C1 | C2 | C3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1+E1 | QM | QM | QM |
| S1+E2 | QM | QM | QM |
| S1+E3 | QM | QM | A |
| S1+E4 | QM | A | B |
| S2+E1 | QM | QM | QM |
| S2+E2 | QM | QM | A |
| S2+E3 | QM | A | B |
| S2+E4 | A | B | C |
| S3+E1 | QM | QM | A |
| S3+E2 | QM | A | B |
| S3+E3 | A | B | C |
| S3+E4 | B | C | D |

### SOTIF Analysis (ISO 21448)

```
Phase 1: Specification and design
  → Identify intended functionality
  → Define performance limitations

Phase 2: Triggering conditions identification
  → Systematic: sensor limitations, algorithm failures, specification gaps
  → Categories:
    - Perception: false positives, false negatives, misclassification
    - Decision: wrong prediction, incorrect planning, delayed response
    - Actuation: control deviation, communication delay

Phase 3: Evaluation of known/unknown scenarios
  → Area 1: Known safe scenarios (intended behavior in known conditions)
  → Area 2: Known unsafe scenarios (identified triggering conditions)
  → Area 3: Unknown unsafe scenarios (unidentified triggering conditions)
  → Area 4: Unknown safe scenarios

  Goal: Reduce Area 2 and Area 3 to acceptable residual risk

Phase 4: Functional modification and verification
  → Modify design to address triggering conditions
  → Verify through testing and analysis
```

### STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis)

```
Step 1: Define purpose of the analysis
  → System-level losses (L): fatality, injury, property damage
  → System-level hazards (H): vehicle in collision path, loss of control

Step 2: Model the control structure
  → Controllers: perception module, planner, actuator controller
  → Control actions: brake, steer, accelerate, lane change
  → Feedback: sensor data, vehicle state, localization

Step 3: Identify Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs)
  For each control action, analyze:
  → Not providing causes hazard
  → Providing causes hazard
  → Too early/too late/wrong order
  → Stopped too soon/applied too long

Step 4: Identify loss scenarios
  → Why could each UCA occur?
  → Controller failures, feedback failures, process model inconsistencies
  → Environmental factors, human factors
```

### FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
```
For each component/function:
1. Potential failure mode
2. Potential effect(s) of failure
3. Severity (1-10)
4. Potential cause(s)
5. Occurrence (1-10)
6. Current detection controls
7. Detection (1-10)
8. RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection
9. Recommended actions
```

### FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)
```
Top event: [Unsafe system behavior]
  ├── OR gate: [Contributing factor 1]
  │   ├── AND gate: [Sub-factor 1a] + [Sub-factor 1b]
  │   └── Basic event: [Component failure]
  ├── OR gate: [Contributing factor 2]
  │   ├── Basic event: [Sensor failure]
  │   └── Basic event: [Algorithm failure]
  └── Basic event: [External cause]
```

## Criticality Metrics

### Time-Based
- **TTC** (Time-to-Collision): Time until collision at current velocities
- **TET** (Time Exposed to TTC): Duration where TTC < threshold
- **TIT** (Time Integrated TTC): Integral of TTC below threshold
- **THW** (Time Headway): Following distance in seconds
- **PET** (Post-Encroachment Time): Time gap between conflicting road users

### Distance-Based
- **DRAC** (Deceleration Rate to Avoid Crash)
- **Required deceleration**: Braking needed to avoid collision
- **Minimum distance**: Closest approach distance

### Probability-Based
- **CPI** (Crash Potential Index): Probability that DRAC > MADR
- **Collision probability**: Via Monte Carlo / reachability analysis
- **RSS distance**: Safe following distance per RSS formulation

### Combined / Advanced
- **Criticality score**: Weighted combination of metrics
- **Risk = Probability × Severity**: Classical risk formulation
- **Safety envelope violation**: Binary indicator of safety boundary breach
