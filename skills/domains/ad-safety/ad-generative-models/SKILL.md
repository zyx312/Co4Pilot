- **Trajectory generation**: Generate diverse, realistic future trajectories
- **Scene generation**: Synthesize driving scenes with controllable layout
- **Sensor data synthesis**: Generate camera/LiDAR data for training
- **Scenario editing**: Modify existing scenarios (add agents, change weather, alter behavior)

### Diffusion Architecture Patterns for AD

```
Pattern 1: Trajectory Diffusion
  Forward: x_0 (clean trajectory) → x_T (noise)
  Reverse: x_T → denoise → x_0 (generated trajectory)
  Conditioning: scene context, map, past trajectory, goal
  Guidance: classifier-free (CFG) or classifier-based (constraints)
  Output: K diverse trajectory samples

Pattern 2: Image/Video Diffusion (Sensor Generation)
  Base: Stable Diffusion / SVD backbone
  Conditioning: BEV layout, 3D bounding boxes, HDMap, camera extrinsics
  Multi-view: Cross-view attention or epipolar constraints
  Output: Multi-camera synchronized images/video

Pattern 3: LiDAR Diffusion
  Representation: Range image, voxel grid, or point cloud
  Forward: Clean LiDAR → noised representation
  Conditioning: BEV layout, semantic map, ego pose
  Output: Realistic LiDAR point cloud / range image

Pattern 4: Guided Diffusion for Controllable Generation
  Unconditional model: p(x)
  Guidance signal: ∇_x log p(constraint | x)
  Constraints: collision avoidance, traffic rules, speed limits, lane keeping
  Inference: x_{t-1} = denoise(x_t) + λ · ∇_x log p(constraint | x_t)
```

### Training Considerations

```
Key challenges for diffusion in AD:
1. Multi-agent consistency — joint generation of all agents' trajectories
2. Physical plausibility — vehicles should obey kinematics/dynamics
3. Map compliance — trajectories should follow road topology
4. Temporal coherence — generated video/LiDAR should be temporally smooth
5. Camera consistency — multi-view generation must be geometrically consistent
6. Controllability vs realism — guidance strength tradeoff
7. Inference speed — diffusion is iterative; need acceleration for real-time
   - DDIM, DPM-Solver, consistency models, distillation
```

## Flow Matching for AD

### Core Concepts
Flow matching learns a continuous-time flow (ODE) that transports noise to data, as an alternative to diffusion's SDE-based denoising. Advantages:
- Simpler training objective (regression on velocity field)
- Straighter transport paths → fewer inference steps
- Flexible noise distributions (not limited to Gaussian)

### Comparison: Diffusion vs Flow Matching

| Aspect | Diffusion | Flow Matching |
|---|---|---|
| Process | SDE-based denoising | ODE-based transport |
| Training | Denoising score matching | Velocity field regression |
| Inference | Iterative denoising (many steps) | ODE integration (fewer steps) |
| Paths | Curved (noising process) | Straight (optimal transport) |
| Speed | Slower (typically 20-50 steps) | Faster (5-20 steps) |
| Quality | Well-established | Competitive, improving |

### AD Applications
| Method | Application | Key Idea |
|---|---|---|
| **FlowBot** (2024) | Motion planning | Flow matching for trajectory generation |
| **MotionFlow** (2024) | Motion prediction | Conditional flow matching for multi-agent prediction |
| **SceneFlow** (2024) | Scene flow estimation | Flow matching for 3D motion |
| **SpatialFlowNet** | Spatial flow fields | Flow-based occupancy prediction |

### Architecture Pattern

```
Flow Matching for Trajectory Generation:
  Input: z_0 ~ N(0,I), context (map, agents, ego state)
  Model: v_θ(z_t, t, context) — predicts velocity field
  Training: L = E[||v_θ(z_t, t) - (z_1 - z_0)||²]  (conditional flow matching)
  Inference: z_1 = z_0 + ∫₀¹ v_θ(z_t, t, context) dt  (ODE solve)
  Output: Generated trajectory z_1

Advantages for AD:
  - Faster inference than diffusion (fewer ODE steps)
  - Natural for continuous trajectory representation
  - Easy to incorporate kinematic constraints in velocity field

### Why 3DGS for AD?
1. **Sensor simulation**: Render photorealistic camera views from novel poses
2. **Scene reconstruction**: Build editable 3D driving scenes from recorded data
3. **Data augmentation**: Re-render existing drives from new viewpoints/conditions
4. **Closed-loop simulation**: Create photorealistic environments for planning evaluation
5. **LiDAR simulation**: Render synthetic LiDAR from Gaussian scene representation

2. **Controllable generation for safety testing**: Generate targeted adversarial scenarios
3. **Sim-to-real gap**: How well do generated scenarios transfer to real-world safety?
4. **Compositionality**: Generate novel combinations of known elements (new intersections, new agent behaviors)
5. **Long-tail generation**: Specifically generate rare, safety-critical scenarios
6. **Evaluation gap**: How to evaluate whether generated data actually improves safety?
7. **Real-time world models**: Fast enough for online planning (< 50ms inference)
