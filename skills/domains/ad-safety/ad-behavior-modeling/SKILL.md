# AD Behavior Modeling

You are an expert in behavior modeling for autonomous driving, with deep knowledge of trajectory prediction, multi-agent interaction modeling, game-theoretic planning, driver behavior analysis, and their implications for AD safety.

## Trigger Conditions

Activate when the user:
- Asks about trajectory prediction or motion forecasting methods
- Needs to model multi-agent interactions in driving scenarios
- Wants to understand game-theoretic approaches to planning
- Asks about driver behavior modeling (human drivers or AD agents)
- References social force models, attention mechanisms for interaction, or graph-based modeling
- Needs to evaluate prediction or behavior models for safety

## Trajectory Prediction / Motion Forecasting

### Problem Formulation

```
Input:
  - Agent history: {(x, y, θ, v)_{t-T_obs}, ..., (x, y, θ, v)_t}  for all agents
  - Map context: lane centerlines, boundaries, crosswalks, traffic signals
  - Ego vehicle state and plan (optional)

Output:
  - Future trajectories: {(x, y)_{t+1}, ..., (x, y)_{t+T_pred}}
  - Multi-modal: K possible futures with probabilities
  - Typically: T_obs = 2s (past), T_pred = 6s (future), K = 6 or 12 modes

Challenges:
  - Multi-modality: Multiple plausible futures (turn left vs go straight)
  - Interaction: Agents influence each other's behavior
  - Map compliance: Predictions should follow road topology
  - Long-tail: Rare behaviors (sudden U-turn, jaywalking) are safety-critical
  - Real-time: Must run within planning cycle (10-50ms)
```

## Interaction Modeling

### Types of Interactions

```
1. Longitudinal interaction:
   - Car following (Intelligent Driver Model, Wiedemann model)
   - Lead vehicle influence, string stability
   - Safety: rear-end collision risk, TTC analysis

2. Lateral interaction:
   - Lane changing (gap acceptance, courtesy, forced merge)
   - Adjacent lane influence, blocking behavior
   - Safety: sideswipe risk, blind spot conflicts

3. Intersection interaction:
   - Right-of-way negotiation, gap acceptance
   - Turn-taking, yielding behavior
   - Safety: T-bone collision, failed yield

4. Vulnerable road user (VRU) interaction:
   - Pedestrian-vehicle: crosswalk, jaywalking, shared space
   - Cyclist-vehicle: overtaking, right-hook, door zone
   - Safety: highest severity outcomes

5. Multi-agent interaction:
   - Merging with multiple vehicles
   - Roundabout negotiation
   - Unprotected intersection with 3+ agents
```

### Interaction Modeling Approaches

|---|---|---|
| **Social Force Model** | Helbing & Molnar (1995) | Repulsive/attractive forces between agents |
| **Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)** | Treiber et al. (2000) | Car-following model with desired speed/gap |
| **MOBIL** | Kesting et al. (2007) | Lane change model (politeness factor) |
| **Social GAN** | Gupta et al. (2018) | GAN with social pooling for pedestrian interaction |
| **Social Attention** | Vemula et al. (2018) | Attention mechanism for social interaction |

#### Implicit Interaction (Learned)
| Approach | Method | Key Idea |
|---|---|---|
| **Graph Neural Networks** | Trajectron++, LaneGCN | Agents as nodes, interactions as edges |
| **Cross-Attention** | HiVT, QCNet, MTR | Agents attend to each other's features |
| **Factorized Attention** | Scene Transformer | Marginal + conditional attention layers |
| **Joint Prediction** | MotionLM, Trajeglish | Predict all agents simultaneously |

#### Game-Theoretic Interaction
| Approach | Key Idea | Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Stackelberg Games** | Leader-follower hierarchy | Ego plans considering others' reactions |
| **Nash Equilibrium** | Simultaneous optimization | Multi-agent intersection negotiation |
| **Level-K reasoning** | Bounded rationality hierarchy | Model sophistication levels of drivers |
| **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)** | Sequential decision under uncertainty | Interactive planning with branching futures |
| **POMDP** | Partially observable decision process | Plan under uncertainty about others' intent |

---

## Game-Theoretic Planning

### Formulations

```
Stackelberg (Leader-Follower):
  Ego (leader): max_{a_ego} J_ego(a_ego, a*_other(a_ego))
  Others (followers): a*_other(a_ego) = argmax_{a_other} J_other(a_ego, a_other)

  Use: Ego plans optimally knowing others will best-respond
  Advantage: Models reactive behavior of other agents
  Challenge: Assumes rationality of other agents

Nash Equilibrium:
  For all agents i: a*_i = argmax_{a_i} J_i(a*_{-i}, a_i)
  No agent can improve by unilaterally changing strategy

  Use: Symmetric multi-agent scenarios (e.g., intersection)
  Advantage: No hierarchy assumption
  Challenge: Multiple equilibria, computation cost, existence

Level-K Reasoning:
  Level 0: Non-strategic (e.g., constant velocity)
  Level 1: Best response to Level 0
  Level 2: Best response to Level 1
  ...

  Use: Model bounded rationality of real drivers
  Advantage: Tractable, captures reasoning depth diversity
  Challenge: Which level to assign to real drivers?
```

### Responsibility and Blame

```
RSS (Responsibility-Sensitive Safety):
  - Define "proper response" for each agent based on road rules
  - Agent is "responsible" if it deviates from proper response
  - Blame assignment: who caused the safety violation?
  - Limitation: Binary; doesn't capture degree of responsibility

SFF (Safety Force Field):
  - Define safety potential field around each agent
  - Planning must not increase total safety potential
  - Provides continuous safety measure

Research frontier:
  - Counterfactual responsibility: "Would the crash have occurred if agent X had acted differently?"
  - Shapley value-based blame attribution
  - Legal alignment: mapping formal responsibility to traffic law

## Safety Connections

### Prediction Failures → Safety Impact

```
Failure Mode                    → Safety Consequence
False negative (miss agent)     → Collision with undetected road user
Mode collapse (single mode)     → Miss alternative future → surprise
Over-confidence                 → Insufficient safety margin
Under-confidence                → Overly conservative, traffic disruption
Interaction blindness           → Miss coupled behaviors (yield chains)
Long-tail miss                  → Fail on rare but critical behaviors
Delayed prediction              → Insufficient reaction time
```

### Safe Prediction Requirements
1. **Calibrated uncertainty**: Predicted confidence should match empirical accuracy
2. **Worst-case awareness**: Consider dangerous modes even if low probability
3. **Interaction consistency**: Multi-agent predictions should be jointly feasible
4. **Map compliance**: Predictions should respect road topology (mostly)
5. **Temporal consistency**: Predictions should not oscillate wildly between frames
6. **Fail-safe behavior**: When uncertain, prediction should trigger conservative planning
7. **Real-time**: Prediction must complete within planning cycle budget

### From Prediction to Planning Safety

```
Conservative approach:
  Plan against worst-case prediction (reachability analysis)
  Pro: Safety guarantee | Con: Overly cautious

Probabilistic approach:
  Plan against full distribution of predicted futures
  Risk = Σ P(mode_i) × Cost(collision with mode_i)
  Pro: Balanced | Con: Risk threshold selection

Contingency planning:
  Generate multiple plans for different prediction outcomes
  Switch plans as predictions update
  Pro: Reactive | Con: Computational cost

Interactive planning:
  Jointly optimize ego plan + predicted agent reactions
  Pro: Captures influence | Con: Assumption about rationality
```
